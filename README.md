# PyPiSearch
Seach things on PyPi.
What this does are;  
1) Using query to send search request for PyPi website,  
2) Getting HTML code containing search results,  
3) Trimming html codes into a list which is easy for human to see.

That's it!  
I wanted to make it avoid using APIs, so I used html request thing.
